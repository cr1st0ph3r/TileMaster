03-08-2017 Idea first conceived

11-08-2017 first prototypes

13-08-2017 addeded base blocks, Air, dirt and Stone

15-08-2017 created the concept of map, camera and player

20-08-2017 player interacts with the map

20-08-2017 created the map serialization logic, so the map can be saved/loaded from a binary file

04-04-2018 created the chunk concept

23-04-2022 Started playing with map generation logic
		   The base map is generated from a set of rules and parameters, and from there
		   some algorithms are applied to form the final tilemap
23-04-2022 borrowed the class Mathf from Unity. Its not currently being used and can later be removed
23-04-2022 took some ideas from this blog post on how to generate maps (https://blog.unity.com/technology/procedural-patterns-you-can-use-with-tilemaps-part-i)

24-04-2022 Took the chunk concept and materialized it, now the render only renders the chunks near the player.
		   ideally (TODO) the chunk loading should follow the camera, but for now follow the player is good enough

25-04-2022 moved the tile definitions to a json file (tiles.json) so its easier to define the tiles
	       still, the tile type ids should follow the enum so the code can mantain integrity
25-04-2022 created the grass spread logic. It checks neighbouring blocks around grass tiles and 'tries' to spread around a 1 block radius
		   its not spreading to other chunks due to a newly discovered chunk load bug that (TODO) needs urgent correction
25-04-2022 the game now has a scrolling background. The code is taken from another project, aswell with the textures, it need to be improved to better suit my game
25-04-2022 the tiles look too homogenous, added a randomization factor to make them look more natural and less artificial
25-04-2022 created a very primitive message system to display various messages to the user. It needs some serious improvements

26-04-2022 created a side project to create the ramdom tiles so the generated tiles has statisticallt the same amount of colors as the retail tiles

27-04-2022 An idea occurred: create a randomness factor index and generate the ramdon tiles at runtime. Needs to check 
		   wether the texture loader support loading images from memory bitmaps or not

28-04-2022 fixed tile loading logic when setting the global tiles to have loca tile properties

30-04-2022 Added a random factor to generate new textures using the colors of the base texture, this gives a grain appearange to the tiles making them look less artificial
30-04-2022 Fixed grass not jumping to neighbouring tiles
30-04-2022 Applied the use of threads to build the initial map dictionary faster
